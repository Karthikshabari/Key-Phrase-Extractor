# Fixes Applied to Keyphrase Extractor App

This document outlines the fixes that have been applied to resolve issues with the Keyphrase Extractor App.

## 1. Package Version Updates

Updated the following packages to match the recommended Expo versions:

- `expo-linking`: Updated from `~6.0.0` to `~6.2.2`
- `react-native`: Updated from `0.73.4` to `0.73.6`

These updates ensure compatibility with the installed Expo version and prevent warnings.

## 2. Icon Display Fixes

Fixed issues with icons not displaying properly, especially on the web platform:

1. **Improved Web Vector Icons Implementation**:
   - Created a comprehensive mapping of icon names to unicode characters in `MaterialCommunityIcon.web.js`
   - Added support for MaterialIcons with `MaterialIcons.web.js`
   - Updated webpack configuration to properly alias these implementations

2. **Enhanced Icon Font Loading**:
   - Improved `iconFonts.js` to load multiple icon fonts with proper font-display settings
   - Added more icon fonts (FontAwesome, Ionicons) for broader support

3. **Webpack Configuration Updates**:
   - Added proper handling for font files
   - Set up aliases for vector icon components

## 3. Keyphrase Display Fixes

Fixed issues with keyphrases not displaying properly:

1. **Improved Error Handling in KeyphraseItem**:
   - Added validation for score values to handle potential undefined or null values
   - Updated score display to use the validated score
   - Fixed score bar width calculation

2. **API Response Handling**:
   - Ensured proper conversion from API response format to the app's internal format
   - Added error handling for malformed responses

## 4. Fix Dependencies Script

Created a comprehensive fix script (`fix_dependencies.bat`) that:

1. Cleans up existing installations:
   - Removes node_modules
   - Deletes package-lock.json and yarn.lock
   - Clears .expo cache

2. Installs dependencies with the correct flags:
   - Uses `--legacy-peer-deps` to handle peer dependency conflicts
   - Installs specific versions of problematic packages

3. Updates packages to recommended versions:
   - Updates expo-linking and react-native to the versions recommended by Expo

## How to Apply These Fixes

1. Run the fix script:
   ```
   .\fix_dependencies.bat
   ```

2. Start the app:
   ```
   npx expo start --web
   ```

3. If you encounter any issues, check the browser console for errors and refer to the TROUBLESHOOTING.md file for additional guidance.

## Technical Details

### Vector Icons Web Implementation

The web implementation of vector icons works by:

1. Loading icon fonts via CSS in `iconFonts.js`
2. Providing React components that render the appropriate unicode characters
3. Using webpack aliases to replace the native implementations with web-specific ones

### Score Validation

The score validation in KeyphraseItem ensures that:

1. Undefined or null scores default to 0.5
2. Score bar width is calculated correctly
3. Color gradients are applied based on the validated score
4. Score text displays the correct value

These fixes ensure that the app works correctly across all platforms and handles edge cases gracefully.
